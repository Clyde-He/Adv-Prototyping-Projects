                <p>In this assignment, we have to visualize and recreate a natural system containing background, interactable elements, and user input. My prototype put the user into a natural environment where trees and wind exist. The user can blow bubbles into the environment and can control the weather in the environment. I considered this scenario because I was fascinated by one of the most classic Windows screensavers, the bubbles, and I want to recreate it with some more elements that users can interact with their mouse and keyboard.</p>
                <p>The following image is the diagram that represents this natural system. By separating different elements into such form, I translated them into code more efficiently, especially for the moving elements: the leaves and the bubbles.</p>

                <p>By utilizing the object-oriented programming techniques, I was able to add different attributes and actions to these elements and let them interact with the primary environment throw the draw() loop.</p>

                <p>The most complicated code I have to deal with in this project is the collision system, especially between different bubbles. I have to use complicated nesting loops and two different array list to compare all the bubbles efficiently. There are also other complicated ideas I haven't implemented, including the graphics-intensive merging animation between bubbles. Besides these ideas, this project's future development should include a more precise collision system between leaves and bubbles, a more appealing GUI, and add more natural force system into more elements.</p>

                <i>Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact. This example shows that prototypes are not necessarily self-explanatory. What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</i>
                <p>This is one of the really inspiring parts for me in the reading. In most of my past projects, I limited my prototypes to only paper wireframes or digital prototypes. This paragraph gave me a new perspective regarding the prototype itself: it can be anything if it can be representative regarding a particular aspect of the design or product itself. Such an idea broaden the prototype's content so much more that I started to realize how I can further manipulate my design iterations in the future. For example, when I'm showing a prototype to a testing user, I can put myself into a preset scenario to demonstrate how the specific product works with a person. In my previous understanding, this can only be a rough storyboard or such. Now it can also be manipulated as a prototype that showcases both the role and the artifact's look and feel.</p>
                <br>
                <i>Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with as much clarity as possible. The solutions found became inputs to an integrated design. Answers to the rendering capability questions addressed by Example 3 informed the design of the role that the artifact could play (guiding how many furniture objects of what complexity could be shown). It also provided guiding constraints for the direct manipulation user interface (determining how much detail the handle forms could have). Similarly, issues of role addressed by Example 1 informed the implementation problem by constraining it: only a constrained set of manipulations was needed for a space-planning application. It also simplified the direct manipulation user interface by limiting the necessary actions and therefore controls which needed to be provided.</i>
                <p>In my past experiences, I always consider prototypes are created procedurally in the process of designing a product, and the designer is responsible for creating prototypes that have more and more fidelity according to the testing and iterating process (which is an opposite idea comparing to the one in the article). But now I started to realize such an approach can be so much different. By creating different types of prototypes simultaneously, the designer can demonstrate and test one's artifact more flexibly and thoroughly. With such a diverse timeline and different prototypes, more types of feedback can be gathered and combined, and more persuasive the artifact itself can be.</p>
                <br>
                <i>Know your prototype; prepare your audience. Be clear about what design questions are being explored with a given prototypeâ€”and what are not. Communicating the specific purposes of a prototype to its audience is a critical aspect of its use. It is up to the designer to prepare an audience for viewing a prototype. Prototypes themselves do not necessarily communicate their purpose. It is especially important to clarify what is and what is not addressed by a prototype when presenting it to any audience beyond the immediate design team.</i>
                <p>As a designer who enjoys iterating prototypes, I was not that familiar with the process of actually testing with users. The concept in this paragraph gave me a clearer perspective of the designer's role in user testing and how vital the interpolation during the process is. It is essential not only to let the user accomplish a specific goal in the prototype and give general feedback towards the overall experiences, but also to provide them with a clearer perspective on what they should expect from the prototype, what are we testing, and what kind feedback we would like to receive.</p>

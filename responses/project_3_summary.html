                <p>The third project is where we push the capabilities of the Particle Argon board to the next level. We are imagining a data visualization system using Argon's collected data, transmitted through the cloud, and visualized in the browser using P5.js. I started to experiment with different sensors, including temperature sensors, light sensors, and Piezo sensors. Using these elements, I created a computer monitoring system that visualizes the user's gameplay (when the user hits the trigger in an FPS game), its PC's fan speed, and its PC's graphic card temperature.

                <p>On the software side, I directly store all of these data as a single string on the Particle.IO cloud. Using a simple data parsing function in P5.js, I distributed all four data in one single read, which can help elevate the server speed and get the data more frequently. After getting these data, I started to visualize them in a 900Ã—650 canvas. The fan speed corresponds with the background color and a toggle in the upper-left corner. The temperature is visualized as a curve in the center of the canvas, and the hit moment is connected with the temperature at the time the user presses the trigger in the real world.</p>

                <p>The hardest part of this project is tuning each sensor's exact data or threshold so they can represent real-world computer usage. I was initially planning to use a loudness sensor to detect the fan voice, but it turned out it only measure a certain threshold rather than continuing to give back real-time reading. The Piezo sensor was also a tricky one, and it took me multiple times to measure the practical range for when the CPU fan or GPU fan turned on.</p>

                <p>In the future, I would make the whole visualization more interesting. Rather than just using graphs, it is interesting to see how these data pare together to create a more intricate or abstract work that still represents a person's gameplay, and I would further explore and expand on the connecting curves between temperature and hit moment and see what new relationship can be discovered.</p>
